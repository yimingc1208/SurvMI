Description: In clinical trials, endpoints are sometimes evaluated with uncertainty. Adjudication is commonly adopted to ensure the study integrity. We propose to use multiple imputation (MI) introduced by Robin (1987) <doi:10.1002/9780470316696> to incorporate these uncertainties if reasonable event probabilities were provided. The method has been applied to Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) model, Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimation and Log-rank test in this package. Moreover, weighted estimations discussed in Cook (2004) <doi:10.1016/S0197-2456(00)00053-2> were also implemented with weights calculated from event probabilities. In conclusion, this package can handle time-to-event analysis if events presented with uncertainty by different methods.
