\title{Cox PH model with MI method
}
\description{
CoxMI function calculates Cox model with uncertain endpoints by using MI method. Users have to provide survival data in a long format with rows for all potential events, together with corresponding event probabilities. Then the long format data should be transformed by the uc_data_transform function before feed into the function.
}
\usage{
CoxMI(data_list,nMI=1000,covariates=NULL,id=NULL,...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data_list}{
 The data list which has been transformed from the long format by the uc_data_transform function.
}
  \item{nMI}{
Number of imputations (>1).
}
  \item{covariates}{
Vector of covariates on the RHS of Cox model. Categorical variables need to be encoded as factor variables before entering the model. This encoding has to be done before the data transform step.
}
  \item{id}{
Vector of id variable if Andersen-Gill model is required.
}
  \item{\dots}{
Other arguments passed on to coxph().
}
}
\details{
Calculates the estimated parameters as in the usual Cox proportional hazards model when event uncertainties present. The data are assumed to consist of potential event times with probabilities or weights between 0 and 1 corresponding to the probability that an event occurred at each time.
